## Project Overview:
<p> The aim of this project is to predict whether a person with specific demographics can afford the median home price in a specific US metro area. The user's income is predicted based on the demographic information entered in the website form and a linear regression  of the historical Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Median home prices were downloaded from Zillow.com. Affordability was determined based on the "mortgage rule of thumb" that a buyer should not spend more than 28% of monthly gross income on a mortgage payment.
